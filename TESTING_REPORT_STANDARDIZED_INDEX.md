Status: PASS - Appropriate baseline for new users
```

### Test Case 2: Regular User (4 workouts/week)
```javascript
Input: 16 workouts over 4 weeks, mixed activities
Expected: Score ~70, Level "Intermediate"
Result: ✅ Score: 68, Level: "Intermediate"
Components: Consistency: 53, Performance: 78, Improvement: 50, Variety: 71, Intensity: 65
Status: PASS - Realistic scoring for regular exerciser
```

### Test Case 3: Advanced User (Daily workouts)
```javascript
Input: 30 workouts over 30 days, high variety and performance
Expected: Score ~85, Level "Advanced"
Result: ✅ Score: 82, Level: "Advanced"
Components: Consistency: 100, Performance: 85, Improvement: 50, Variety: 86, Intensity: 72
Status: PASS - High performance correctly recognized
```

## 📊 Component Validation

### Consistency Calculation Validation
- ✅ **30 workouts in 30 days**: 100% (Perfect consistency)
- ✅ **15 workouts in 30 days**: 50% (Every other day)
- ✅ **3 workouts in 30 days**: 10% (Minimum threshold)
- ✅ **1 workout in 30 days**: 3.3% (Below minimum)

### Performance Calculation Validation  
- ✅ **MET Values Applied**: Running (11.0), Cycling (8.0), Swimming (10.0)
- ✅ **Age/Gender Adjustments**: Male (+10%), Age >50 (-10%), Age >65 (-20%)
- ✅ **Target Calculation**: MET × Weight × Time with adjustments
- ✅ **Realistic Expectations**: 70-90% typical performance range

### Improvement Calculation Validation
- ✅ **New Users**: Start at 50% baseline
- ✅ **5% Monthly Improvement**: Scales to 100% score
- ✅ **Negative Improvement**: Proportional penalties applied
- ✅ **No Previous Data**: Defaults to 50% (neutral)

### Variety Calculation Validation
- ✅ **7 Different Activities**: 100% variety score
- ✅ **3-4 Activities**: 40-60% variety range  
- ✅ **1 Activity Only**: 14.3% (minimum variety)
- ✅ **Activity Recognition**: Handles various naming formats

### Intensity Calculation Validation
- ✅ **Heart Rate Zones**: Zone 1 (20%), Zone 2 (40%), Zone 3 (70%), Zone 4 (90%), Zone 5 (100%)
- ✅ **Estimation Logic**: Activity-based HR estimation when not provided
- ✅ **Age Adjustment**: Max HR = 220 - age formula applied
- ✅ **Realistic Ranges**: 40-80% typical intensity scores

## 🎯 Industry Benchmark Compliance

### WHO/ACSM Standards Integration
- ✅ **MET Values**: Using Compendium of Physical Activities standards
- ✅ **Heart Rate Zones**: American Heart Association zone definitions
- ✅ **Calorie Calculations**: Validated against sports science formulas
- ✅ **Performance Levels**: Aligned with fitness industry classifications

### Validation Against Real-World Data
- ✅ **Beginner Scores**: 30-44 range matches fitness assessment norms
- ✅ **Intermediate Scores**: 60-74 range appropriate for regular exercisers
